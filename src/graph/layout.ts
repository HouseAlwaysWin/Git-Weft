/**
 * Turns a commit list into lanes and connecting lines.
 *
 * Ported from GitFlick's `Services/CommitGraphBuilder.cs`, which in turn adapts SourceGit's
 * `Models/CommitGraph.cs` (MIT - see THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md). The shape of it:
 *
 * - A lane is an open line waiting for a specific SHA (`Lane.next`). The lane table is an ordered
 *   list - its index *is* the column.
 * - For each commit, the **leftmost** lane waiting for it wins and continues, re-aimed at the
 *   commit's first parent. Any other lane waiting for the same commit collapses into it.
 * - Freeing a lane and shifting the lanes right of it leftwards are the same operation: the
 *   running X is simply not advanced for a lane that dies.
 * - Extra parents of a merge take one of two paths: if the parent already has a lane, emit a
 *   curved link into it; if not, open a new lane. Handling only one of the two loses half the
 *   merge arcs.
 *
 * Requires commits ordered so a parent never precedes its child (`--date-order` or `--topo-order`);
 * otherwise lanes wait forever for a SHA that already went past.
 *
 * **What this port adds over the C# original:** the layout is *resumable*. The whole algorithm is
 * a single forward pass, so its entire continuation is `{unsolved lanes, colour queue, rowIndex}`.
 * Holding that in a `LayoutState` lets page N+1 be laid out without touching a single row of
 * pages 1..N - which is what makes a 100k-commit repo viable, and incidentally means a commit's
 * colour never changes once assigned.
