/**
 * Turning git's stderr into something a person can act on.
 *
 * Raw git output is written for someone at a terminal who can read the next paragraph and type the
 * fix. In a UI it is a wall of text with the useful sentence buried in it, and the suggested
 * remedy - which git usually does give - lost entirely.
 *
 * This works because `gitEnv` pins `LC_ALL=C`: git's messages come back in English no matter what
 * locale the machine runs in, so matching on them is stable rather than a guess about the user's
 * system language.
 *
 * The rule for adding an entry: match on the shortest phrase git will not casually reword, and
 * always keep the original text - the mapped sentence is for the dialog, the original is for the
 * command log when the mapping turns out to be wrong.
