/**
 * Running git.
 *
 * The conventions here are lifted from GitFlick's `Services/GitService.cs`, which already paid for
 * them on Windows:
 *
 * - **Never go through a shell.** Arguments are passed as an array, so a branch called
 *   `feature/a b & c` cannot turn into two commands.
 * - **`-c core.quotepath=false`** or git octal-escapes every non-ASCII byte in a path, and
 *   CJK filenames come back as gibberish.
 * - **`-c i18n.logOutputEncoding=UTF-8`** or commit messages come back in the system codepage.
 * - **Decode from Buffers, not string chunks.** A multi-byte character straddling two chunk
 *   boundaries decodes to replacement characters if each chunk is stringified on arrival.
 * - **`--no-show-signature`** on anything that reads commits: signature verification shells out to
 *   gpg per commit and can hang for seconds.
 *
 * On top of that this adds what a scrolling UI needs: a bounded process pool, so a fast scroll
 * cannot fork fifty gits, and cancellation, so superseded queries stop burning CPU.
