/**
 * Stashes.
 *
 * A stash is a commit, which is why it can appear in the graph at all - but a commit with a shape
 * that would look absurd drawn literally. `git stash` records two or three parents: where HEAD was,
 * the state of the index, and, when `-u` was used, the untracked files. Drawn as-is, every stash
 * becomes a three-way merge blob attached to nothing anyone recognises.
 *
 * So Weft keeps only the first parent. The index and untracked-files parents are how git stores a
 * stash, not something the user put there.
 *
 * The other quirk: only the newest stash is a ref. `stash@{1}` and older live in the reflog of
 * `refs/stash`, so `--all` never sees them and they have to be named by SHA.
