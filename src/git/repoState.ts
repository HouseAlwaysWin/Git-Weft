 * What the repository is in the middle of, and what would be lost if we acted on it.
 *
 * Two questions, both of which every write action has to ask first:
 *
 * **"What operation am I in?"** git records this as files in the git directory rather than
 * anywhere queryable, and getting it wrong is the top source of bugs in this kind of tool - it is
 * what produces "merge failed: you are in the middle of a rebase" three steps later. Note these
 * live in the **per-worktree** git dir, not the common one: two worktrees can be mid-different
 * operations at the same time.
 *
 * **"Is there uncommitted work?"** Tier-3 actions have to name the files they would destroy, and
 * "are you sure?" without a list is not a warning, it is a shrug.
