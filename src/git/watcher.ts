/**
 * Noticing that the repository changed underneath us.
 *
 * git has no change notification, so the only option is to watch the filesystem. Two decisions
 * matter:
 *
 * **What to watch.** GitFlick watches the whole working tree, which is right for a GUI that also
 * shows uncommitted changes but far too expensive here - on a repository with 100k files it means
 * a recursive watch over all of them to learn about a branch switch. The graph only cares about
 * refs and HEAD, so watch the git directory instead. That is also where the worktree split bites:
 * refs and `packed-refs` live in the **common** dir and are shared, while `HEAD` lives in the
 * **per-worktree** dir. Watch only one and a branch switch inside a linked worktree goes unseen.
 *
 * **When to believe it.** One git command touches many paths in a burst - `index.lock`, the index,
 * refs, then the working tree - so events are debounced. And even after the dust settles, a
 * filesystem event is not proof anything the graph cares about actually moved: the caller confirms
 * with a cheap ref probe before paying for a reload.

/**
 * What the graph is drawn from, in two parts that cost different amounts to act on.
 *
 * `refs` is every ref and where it points, with `*` on the branch HEAD is on, and HEAD's own commit
 * for when it is on none. It used to name HEAD by its commit alone, so checking out another branch
 * at the same commit changed nothing here - no reload, and a graph following the branch you are on
 * went on drawing the one you had left. `%(HEAD)` says which branch without a process of its own.
 *
 * `operation` is what git is halfway through, from the marker files in the git dir. A merge that
 * stops on a conflict moves no ref, so without this it drew no banner until something else happened
 * to reload the graph - and when only this part changes, the banner is all there is to redraw.
 *
 * Still what stops a filesystem event from costing a full reload: `for-each-ref` is a couple of
 * milliseconds against seconds to re-walk a large history, and the operation is a handful of file
 * checks with no process at all.
