/**
 * Fetch, pull and push.
 *
 * These were left until last on purpose. The operations are one git command each; the work is
 * everything around them - a remote that does not answer, a branch with nothing to track, a push
 * the server refuses, two histories that have drifted apart. That long tail is why `errors.ts`
 * exists, and most of this milestone's weight landed there rather than here.
 *
 * Two boundaries are held firmly:
 *
 * **Credentials are not Weft's business.** Whatever credential helper is already configured -
 * Git Credential Manager, an ssh agent, a `.netrc` - is what authenticates. Weft never implements
 * an askpass, never stores a token, never touches OAuth. An authentication failure is a clear
 * message pointing at where the user already signs in, not the beginning of a login flow.
 *
 * **`--force` is not offered.** Only `--force-with-lease`, and only after fetching, because a lease
 * checked against a remote-tracking ref nobody has updated in a week is not a safety check - it is
 * the appearance of one.
