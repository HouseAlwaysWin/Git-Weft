/**
 * What you can do to a thing in the graph.
 *
 * Every action is one entry in one of the action modules, and the context menu is rendered from
 * what this returns - so adding an action never means touching the webview. That matters more than
 * it sounds: the menu has to know whether an action is *available* right now, and availability
 * depends on repository state the webview does not have.
 *
 * The vocabulary lives in `types.ts` rather than here, so the dependency runs one way: this module
 * knows about the action modules, and they know about the types. Sharing a file made a cycle that
 * TypeScript accepted and ESM did not.
