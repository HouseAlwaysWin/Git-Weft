 * importing `Tier` from the registry - which imports the action module - produced a cycle that
 * TypeScript is happy with and ESM is not: `Tier` was still in its temporal dead zone when the
 * action module ran.
 *
 * Nothing here imports `vscode`, which is what lets every action be driven from a test against a
 * real repository with no editor in the room.
