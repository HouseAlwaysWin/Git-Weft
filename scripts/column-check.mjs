/**
 * Do the column controls still reach the stylesheet?
 *
 * The layout is split across two files on purpose. The webview's content security policy has no
 * `unsafe-inline` for styles, so a generated stylesheet is not available; what the script can do is
 * set custom properties, and what the stylesheet does is read them. That works, and it fails
 * silently: rename a property on one side and the columns stop resizing, stop hiding, or quietly
 * lose their alignment with the header - with no error anywhere, because a `var()` that resolves to
 * nothing falls back and a `setProperty` nobody reads is not an error.
 *
 * So the two halves are checked against each other. Every property the script sets has to be read
 * by a rule, every property a rule reads has to be set by the script, and every column has to have
 * both of its rules - the header's and the row's - because a column whose header moved and whose
 * cells did not is the one failure that looks like working software.
