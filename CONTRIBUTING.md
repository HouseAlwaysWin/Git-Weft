```bash
npm install
npm run build      # or: npm run watch
npm test           # build, unit tests, then a full end-to-end run against a throwaway repo
npm run typecheck
npm run color-check  # contrast and separation of the author tints, in both themes
npm run column-check # the column controls against the stylesheet that has to read them
npm run icon-check   # renders the icons at the size they are actually drawn
```

`media/icon.png` is the marketplace icon and is committed rather than built: it has to be a PNG,
none of the five devDependencies can draw one, and a rasteriser for a single file that changes about
never would be the largest dependency here by an order of magnitude. It is rendered from
`media/icon.svg`, which is the source. To redo it, serve the SVG and let a browser rasterise it:

```bash
npm run icon-check && node scripts/serve.mjs   # then, in the page's console:
```

```js
const svg = await (await fetch('/icons/icon.svg')).text();
const img = new Image();
img.src = URL.createObjectURL(new Blob([svg], { type: 'image/svg+xml' }));
await img.decode();
const c = Object.assign(document.createElement('canvas'), { width: 128, height: 128 });
c.getContext('2d').drawImage(img, 0, 0, 128, 128);
copy(c.toDataURL('image/png').split(',')[1]); // then base64 -d > media/icon.png
```

`npm test` checks the result is a square PNG of at least 128px, so a stale or broken one fails the
build rather than the upload.

To look at the view without VS Code — it renders the real webview with real repository data:

```bash
npm run build && node scripts/preview.mjs <repo> --max=20000 && node scripts/serve.mjs
```

To tell whether a change moved the view when it was not meant to, the probe drives that same
preview in headless Chrome and records what it builds and what each click asks the extension to do.
`npm test` holds it to a few invariants; the rest is for while you work:

```bash
npm run ui-probe -- save before       # record the view as it is now
npm run ui-probe -- check before      # after a change: which sections moved
npm run ui-probe -- stable            # the recording reproduces, so a difference means something
npm run ui-probe -- control spec.mjs  # put each bug back and require the probe to notice
```

It records against a demo repository it builds fresh, and needs Chrome (`--chrome` or `WEFT_CHROME`
if it is not in the usual place) - without one it stops rather than passing.

To build a large repository to test against:

```bash
node scripts/make-fixture.mjs /tmp/weft-100k 100000
```

Tests run on Node's built-in runner with native TypeScript type stripping, so there is no test
framework dependency. `erasableSyntaxOnly` is on in `tsconfig.json` to keep it that way — no
`enum`, no namespaces, no parameter properties.
