# Git Weft

A Git commit graph for VS Code, fast on large repositories.

Weft is an independent extension, written from scratch. It is not a fork of, and shares no code
with, any other graph extension.

## Status

Early, but in daily use. Reading is complete; writing is arriving one tier at a time.

Working:

- Commit graph with branches, merges, tags, remotes and HEAD
- Ordinary clones, bare repositories, linked worktrees and submodules
- More than one repository in a workspace: opening the graph asks which, one graph per repository,
  each its own tab. **Branches & Tags** and **Authors** follow whichever graph you are looking at,
  and remember what you had ticked in the others
- Streaming load: the first rows paint while git is still walking
- Virtualized rendering: a 20,000-row history keeps 31 row elements in the DOM
- A row for the working tree when there is one, above the history and hanging off HEAD by a dashed
  line, with what is staged, unstaged and untracked. Click it and the same **Commit Files** section
  lists them; click a file and the diff is HEAD against the file as it is on disk. It keeps up with
  the tree as you save, without re-walking the history to do it
- Where the branch stands against the one it tracks, and how old that answer is:
  `main ↑2 ↓1 fetched 3h ago` beside the title. The age is not decoration - see the design note
- Right-click a local branch or a tag in **Branches & Tags** to delete it. A remote branch gets a
  separate entry, **Delete on Remote...**, because it is a push to a server rather than a change to
  this clone - the confirmation says which remote, what stops being reachable there, which local
  branches are left tracking nothing, and that there is no reflog on the far end
- Order the walk by commit date, author date, or topologically - the dropdown beside the search.
  Topological keeps a branch's commits together instead of interleaving them by date, which on a
  history with concurrent branches is a different graph within a handful of rows
- Fetch on a timer if you want one (`weft.autoFetchMinutes`, off by default). Weft also picks up
  fetches it did not run, including VS Code's own `git.autofetch`: the watcher sees the refs move
- Click or arrow-key a commit for its message and metadata; what it changed lands in the **Commit
  Files** section in Source Control, as a folded tree or a flat list
- One file's history: right-click it in **Commit Files** for **Show File History**, and the graph
  narrows to that path with renames followed - so it does not stop where the file was moved. The
  path search has a `follow` switch of its own for a path you type
- The branch button in the header lists every branch: click a name to check it out, or use the
  ticks to choose which branches the graph draws. The ticks are the same ones as in **Branches &
  Tags**, not a second copy. Local and Remote roll up, and each heading has a tick for all of
  them - which acts on what the filter box has left listed, so narrowing and then unticking hides
  exactly what you can see
- Right-click to copy: a commit's hash or subject, a branch or tag's name - and its full ref name,
  which is the one git resolves rather than the one you read. Files in **Commit Files** copy their
  path either way round, relative or absolute
- Compare two commits: right-click one for **Select for Compare**, then another for **Compare
  with …** - the two steps VS Code's own file compare uses, and ctrl-click does the same pair
  without the menu. The Commit Files section fills with what they differ by, and the pane says how
  far apart they are: a count for each side, because two commits picked off a graph are not always
  one behind the other. The marked commit stays named in the title bar and one click goes back to
  it, because the two commits worth comparing are rarely both on screen - and the mark is held by
  hash, so searching for the far one does not throw it away. Escape drops both
- Click a file there to open it in VS Code's own diff editor, renames included
- Search by message, author, committer, diff content (`-G`) or path, pushed down into `git log`.
  Match case, regular expression, all-words and invert are switches inside the box, each offered
  only in the modes where git can honour it - and text is the default, so `v0.4.1` no longer
  quietly also matches `v0X4Y1`. Paste a hash instead and it selects that commit rather than
  grepping for it, and whatever matched is marked in the row
- A **first parent** switch: walk the mainline and leave out what was merged into it, which also
  takes the merge arcs with it rather than leaving them pointing at rows that are no longer there
- A date filter beside the search: today, the last 7, 30 or 365 days, or a custom range. It narrows
  the walk like every other filter here, and combines with them - "what did Ada touch today" is one
  question. It compares git's committer date rather than the author date the column shows, which is
  the same thing except for rewritten history
- One button drops every filter at once - the search, the date range, and the branch and author
  ticks in Source Control - and it is on screen only while there is something to drop. The sort is
  left alone: it hides nothing, and it has a way back of its own
- Auto-refresh: commit from a terminal and the graph reloads itself
- Right-click to act: checkout (branch, remote branch, or a commit detached), create and rename
  branches, create lightweight or annotated tags, delete branches and tags
- Merge and rebase, with a banner while either is unfinished: Continue, Skip, Abort, and the
  conflicted files as links into VS Code's merge editor
- Cherry-pick, revert, and reset (soft, mixed or hard) from any commit
- Stashes appear in the graph, with apply, pop and drop on the row and a Stash Changes command
- Column headers, and a click on one sorts by description, author, date or commit. A sorted list is
  flat: a lane's Y coordinate is a row index, so in any order but git's the lines would join commits
  that are no longer neighbours. A third click puts the graph back
- A graph opens on the branch you are on, and a checkout takes it with you. Everything else is
  unticked until you say otherwise: a clone with fourteen hundred refs spends seconds walking all
  of them to draw a graph so wide that the branch you came to look at is one lane among hundreds.
  **Show All Branches & Tags** is one click away, and between checkouts the ticks are yours - the
  first one you move stops the default applying, and Clear Filters hands it back. Switching branch
  starts again from the new one, hand-picked set included: a graph still drawing the branch you
  left is drawing the wrong thing
- Three buttons for the three answers worth one click - everything, nothing, and the branch you are
  on - over the branch list and again in the graph's own header. Ticking three refs out of fourteen
  hundred starts by unticking the rest, which is not something anybody does a box at a time
- A box in the header switches branches: type a name, arrows to aim, Return or a click to check
  out - it asks first, and says how long since that branch moved - and Escape to give it up. Its list is plain - one row, one thing, and clicking it goes there.
  The button beside it is the other question, and keeps its own list of ticks: which branches the
  graph should draw
- Who last changed the line the cursor is on, greyed at the end of it, with the commit’s
  subject and how long ago. One line rather than all of them: the file still looks like a file.
  It blames the buffer, not what is on disk, so unsaved edits do not shift every annotation
  below them onto the wrong line - and the line you just typed says so. Hover it for the sha and
  the date, and for **Show in the graph**: a graph beside the file with the cursor on that commit,
  waiting for the page that carries it if it is forty thousand rows down. `weft.inlineBlame`
  turns it off
- **Show File History** on any file - in the Explorer, on a tab, inside an editor, or in the
  changed-files list - narrows the graph to the commits that touched it, following renames
- **Toggle File Blame**, on the editor’s right-click menu, puts every line’s author and date in
  a column down the left. Off unless asked for, and per file: it moves the code right and gives
  the eye a second column, which is worth it while reading a file’s history and in the way while
  writing it. The two annotations share one blame, so having both on costs one `git blame`
- **only here** walks what the ticked branches have and no other ref does. Ticking a branch narrows
  where git starts, not what it reaches - a branch cut off a trunk with three hundred others merged
  into it still reaches all of them, which is not what "show me this branch" looks like it means
- Two filters in the Source Control sidebar: untick branches, remotes or tags to keep them out of
  the walk, and tick authors to show only theirs. Both narrow what `git log` walks rather than
  hiding rows
- Right-click a branch there to check it out, or to **Show Only This** - unticking narrows the tips
  git walks *from*, so hiding one branch changes nothing while its commits are still reachable from
  another, which for a merged branch is always
- The text filter over that list is a way to find a ref, not a way to filter the graph, and the
  message under it says so with the numbers: `Listing 1 of 24 refs matching "claude/". Nothing is
  unticked, so the graph still walks all 24.` One button applies the listing to the graph when that
  is what you meant
- Branches & Tags sorts by name or by most recently moved - alphabetical to find a name you know,
  by date to see which of a hundred and fifty branches anybody is still working on
- Every branch says how long since it last moved, wherever it is listed - the switch box, the
  header list, and Branches & Tags. Which of a hundred and fifty branches are still alive is the
  question a list of names cannot answer, and it matters most just before you switch to one
- A text filter for the branch list itself, for repositories with more refs than fit on screen,
  and a button that lists only what is ticked - on a clone with fourteen hundred refs the ticks
  are what you are looking at, and finding them again is otherwise a scroll past everything else.
  Both narrow the listing and leave the graph alone
- **Authors** has the same filter the branch list has, for the same reason: on a repository with
  two hundred contributors, finding the one you want is what stands between you and ticking them.
  Narrow to a name, a surname or a company's email domain, then one button shows the graph exactly
  the people left listed. What you typed stays beside the section's title while it applies, because
  a filter you cannot see is one you forget is on
- One row per author, sorted by commits or by name. Several addresses, or several spellings of one
  name - `Sean Lin`, `sean_lin`, `SEAN_LIN` - are one row and one count, with every spelling shown
  on it. Ticking that row names all of them to `git log`, so what it counted is what the graph
  walks. Names that differ by more than case and separators are left alone, and a shared address
  merges nothing: one service account is a dozen people. The count covers the whole history back to
  the root commit and does not move when the graph is narrowed to a date range or a branch
- Each author gets their own colour, derived from the name so it never shifts as pages stream in
- **Git Weft: Manage Remotes...** in the command palette lists what each remote points at, and
  adds, renames, repoints or removes one. Adding fetches it; removing says how many
  remote-tracking branches go with it
- Merging asks how only when there is something to ask: a branch that is strictly behind can
  fast-forward or take a merge commit, and one that has diverged can only do the latter, so it is
  not offered a choice of one. **Squash** is its own entry rather than a third option, because it
  declines to join the histories at all - it stages the changes and leaves the commit to Source
  Control, and says up front that git will still call the branch unmerged afterwards
- Fetch, pull and push, using whatever credential helper is already set up - Weft never asks for
  a password and never stores one. Pull asks whether to merge or rebase only when the histories
  have actually diverged, and force push is `--force-with-lease` after a fetch, never `--force`
- The lanes get at most a third of the panel until you say otherwise, and a grip of their own to say
  it with. A history with thirty concurrent branches wants three hundred and sixty pixels of graph,
  which on a side panel is the whole width - and the subject column, which is what people came to
  read, becomes `feat(s…`. Given less room the lanes are drawn closer together rather than cut off:
  a graph missing its right-hand branches is a graph lying about the history. What they ask for is
  what the rows on screen need, not what the widest row in the history needed - the widest row in a
  repository with a hundred branches is almost never the one you are reading, and paying its width
  everywhere means a column that is mostly blank and lanes squeezed for no reason
- The Date column shows the day, and the time as well once it is dragged wide enough to hold it -
  the format follows the width rather than a setting, because widening that column is already the
  gesture for "these two are on the same day and I need to tell them apart". The whole timestamp
  with its offset is on hover at any width
- Drag the line between two column headings to resize a column, double-click it to put the width
  back, and right-click the headings to switch Author, Date or Commit off. Description stays: it is
  the `1fr` the others leave their space to, and the column people came to read. All of it is
  remembered across panel reloads
- Draggable split between the graph and the details pane, remembered across panel reloads

Anything that could destroy uncommitted work names the files it would destroy before asking, and
nothing passes `--force` by default.

## Where to find it

The graph opens as an editor tab. Three ways in:

- The **Weft** button in the status bar (hidden when the workspace has no repository)
- The branch icon in the **Source Control** title bar
- **Weft: Open Git Graph** in the command palette

Weft has no Activity Bar icon of its own. Its three sections - **Commit Files**, **Branches &
Tags** and **Authors** - live in **Source Control**, under the changes list: collapsed until you
want them, and absent altogether in a workspace with no repository. Unticking a ref there narrows
what `git log` walks, so a repository carrying two hundred `origin/dependabot/*` branches stops
paying for them.

## Design notes

**The layout is resumable.** Lane assignment is a single forward pass, so its entire continuation is
`{open lanes, colour queue, row index}`. Holding that in a `LayoutState` means page N+1 is laid out
without touching a row of pages 1..N — which is what makes a large repository viable, and has the
side effect that a commit's colour never changes once assigned.

**Lanes are polylines that only turn.** A lane running straight for a thousand rows costs two
points. Measured on a 100k-commit repository: 100,000 rows of graph, 7,998 points.

**The network actions are not the ones Source Control already has.** They look like duplicates and
are not: `git.fetchOnPull` is off by default, so the built-in pull fetches only the branch it is
about to merge and leaves the rest of the graph as stale as it found it. Weft's fetches the whole
remote, then re-reads the counts before deciding anything. `git.rebaseWhenSync` is off too, so a
divergence becomes a merge commit without being mentioned; Weft asks, and says what rebase does to
the hashes before it does it. Behind but not ahead is `merge --ff-only`, so there is no accidental
merge commit at all. The buttons are the duplication; the behaviour is the reason.

**A remote-tracking ref is a local pointer.** `origin/main` moves when something fetches and at no
other time, so every ahead/behind count is a statement about the last fetch rather than about now.
Three hours offline and `↓0` still means "nothing had arrived three hours ago" - which read without
a timestamp means "you are up to date", and that is the whole way a graph misleads about a remote.
So the age travels with the counts and stays on screen when they are zero, because zero is the
number most likely to be believed. `FETCH_HEAD`'s mtime is the answer, and costs one `stat`.

Acting on those counts is a separate problem, and solved separately: pull fetches the whole remote
first and then *re-reads* the counts before deciding anything, because the ones it was given are
stale by definition.

**The working tree is watched by someone else.** `RepoWatcher` watches `.git`, which is where a ref
moving shows up and is deliberately not where a file being saved does - watching a whole worktree
means an event per keystroke of an editor's autosave. So the working-tree row listens to the
built-in git extension instead, which is already running `git status` on its own debounce. What it
triggers is one `git status`, not a reload: saving a file changes nothing a walk would produce
differently, and re-walking would be paying for the whole graph to move one row's worth of text.

**The working tree is a row, not a commit.** It is built in the view rather than sent by the host,
and deliberately kept out of the lane layout: a lane point's Y *is* a commit's row index, so a row
that appears and disappears as files are saved would renumber every one of them and force a
re-layout of the whole history. Instead it takes display position zero and the canvas shifts down
by one - one number, no re-layout, and a dashed line to say that nothing up there is reachable yet.

**The pane is for the commit, the sidebar is for its files.** The details pane is wide and short;
a file list is narrow and tall. Ten files in a 200px strip under a 20,000-row history was the wrong
shape for both, so the list is a tree view now - which also means folding, status colours and
one-click opening come from VS Code rather than from three hundred lines of webview.

**The checkboxes are Weft's, not VS Code's.** A tree view manages checkbox state itself unless
told otherwise, and what it means by a ticked parent is "every child is ticked" - which it will
enforce at the next render. Weft means something else by a ticked group: "some of these are
showing". The two disagreeing looked like unticking a branch putting its own tick straight back on,
and the fix is one flag saying who owns them.

**`--follow` will not take a pathspec with magic in it.** `git log --follow -- ':(icase)src/x.ts'`
is not a quieter answer, it is `fatal: pathspec magic not supported by --follow`, and it takes the
whole walk with it - which matters because a path search is case-insensitive by default, so the
obvious combination is the broken one. Following renames therefore matches the path exactly, and
the case switch is shown locked on rather than offering something git will refuse.

**git's date flags need spelling out.** A bare `--since=2026-07-24` is not midnight: approxidate
fills the unspecified fields from the current clock, so run at 20:08 it means that evening - and
answers differently an hour later. Measured, it returned one commit from a day that held twelve.
`--until=<day>` likewise means *before* that day. Both bounds are sent with an explicit time, and
the lower one as `--since-as-filter` where git is new enough (2.37): plain `--since` stops walking
at the first commit older than the cutoff, which hides newer commits behind an older one in a
history whose dates are not monotonic. That gives up the early exit, which streaming makes
affordable - rows still appear as they are found.

**git's regexes are basic ones, not the ones you think in.** `--grep`, `--author` and `-G` are
POSIX *basic* regular expressions, where `+ ? ( ) { } |` are literal until you escape them - `\+`
is the one-or-more operator. Escaping a name the JavaScript way turns `C++` into a pattern meaning
something else and `A|B` into two different people, so the escape is one named function with the
dialect written down beside it. `--fixed-strings` would do the job, and is not used: it is a global
flag, so it would also reach the `--author` arguments the Authors sidebar contributes.

**Y is measured in rows, not pixels.** A point at `y` is drawn at `y * rowHeight - scrollTop`, so
the canvas stays locked to the row text and changing the row height needs no re-layout. It is also
why sorting hides the graph rather than redrawing it: reorder the rows and the text slides out from
under lines that are still where the layout put them.

**One streaming `git log`, not paged calls.** Paging with `--skip=N` makes git re-walk N commits per
page, which is quadratic across a full scroll; separate calls can also straddle a ref update and
produce a history that contradicts itself. One long-lived process walks a single consistent
snapshot and the graph paints as records arrive.

## Measurements

On a synthetic 100,000-commit repository (`scripts/make-fixture.mjs`), Windows 11, git 2.55:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| First page on screen | 622 ms |
| Full history walked and laid out | 1.1 s |
| Throughput | ~90,000 commits/sec |
| Graph points for 100k rows | 7,998 |
| Parsed history in memory | 68 MB |
| First row: commit date / author date / topological | 521 / 551 / 517 ms |

The three orderings cost the same, which is worth saying because it sounds as though they should
not. All three make git read the history before it emits a row, so none of them is the cheap one -
and git's own chronological order, which *is* cheap, is not on offer: it can put a parent before its
child under clock skew, and the lane layout cannot survive that. The choice is which shape the
history reads best in, not what it is worth waiting for.

Memory is the number that still needs work: 68 MB of commit objects is more than an extension host
should hold, and the next optimisation is a columnar store rather than one object per commit.
